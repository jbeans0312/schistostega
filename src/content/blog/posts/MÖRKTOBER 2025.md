# 10-3, DAGGERS
*Power*

THE PALE ELVES, hairless creatures of moonlit flesh, forged three terrible daggers each with their own voracious inscription. Driven mad by the moon, the Pale Elves devoured each other and the daggers were lost. The Blood Countess covets them for she knows that the daggers' inscriptions will be revealed when wet with blood. Read them to channel their powers.

| **d3** | **PALE DAGGER INSCRIPTIONS**                                                                                                                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1      | GAZE UPON THE BLEEDING MOON: A great orb of moonlight appears above a creature's head for d6 rounds, all bathed in the light are compelled to attack the creature. |
| 2      | SEEK LUNAR COUNSEL: You are teleported to the moon for d4 rounds. Presence test each round to seek wisdom from the lunar presence.                                 |
| 3      | WITH MOONLIT EYES: Your eyes flash with blinding moonlight. 2 creatures take d6 damage and you are blinded for d2 rounds.                                          |

# 10-2, MAW
*Location*

**THE LIPS THAT SPEAK OF A NEW WORLD**

THERE'S A MOUTH BENEATH THE GOBLIN HILLS. Follow the steps beneath the crumbling basilisk church and you'll find it. The stone walls of the lowest chamber bead with condensation from its breath. Its maw is large enough to down an ox in a single bite. It senses fresh corpses and smiles as they approach; crimson gums betray perfectly white teeth sharpened on the bones of its last meal. 

AS LONG AS IT LIVES, IT HUNGERS. As long as flesh walks the earth, it will be satiated. The Cult of Open Lips--forever smiling madmen from across the lands--don their cloaks of crimson and harvest the Goblin Hills. A corpse wagon follows them, piled high with goblin spawn, their master's acquired taste.

A PEARL GROWS BENEATH ITS TONGUE. It is said that the pearl will become a new world once it is fully formed, once the lips' hunger is satiated...

| d4  | Adventure Hooks                                                                                       |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | The cult and their cart creep closer to civilized lands. This must not be. AMBUSH.                    |
| 2   | The Kind King's suicide march looms near. You must show him the pearl, show him hope.                 |
| 3   | You seek family in the cult. Ride on their corpse cart. There's a body in the pile that shouldn't be. |
| 4   | You awaken beneath a mound of goblins. You fell in battle. Must escape the lips.                      |

# 10-1, FROG
*Monster*

I am not fond of frogs or toads. Videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ctqr0RSoQY0) always freaked me out growing up. Here is a terrible creature of slimy skin and tacky tongue.

**Grelb, Scum Frog**
**HP** 32 | **Morale** 6 | **Thick Hide** d2 | **Strike** 2d4 or **Tongue** d6 + special

**Special:** Either pull target to self or disarm target.

BENEATH THE UNDEAD VALLEY'S SHIMMERING SCUM a creature with a tongue the length of two men marinates in the cursed muck, waiting for its next meal. The frog attacks with surprise and tries to drag its victim beneath the scum. If drawn out of the muck, the frog expels a stinking bubble of swamp curse from its maw each round. The target tests Agility DR14 or is covered in swamp curse for 1 day. Swamp creatures are attracted to the smell like a hound is attracted to a limp ewe.

*Captured 50s     Eyes 75s     Tongue 200 s*
