The following is a thread of my MÖRKTOBER 2025 creations. For more information about MÖRKTOBER, visit the [Exuent Press website](https://www.exeunt.press/morktober).
# 10-6, HUSK
*Character Feature*

YEARS OF ENDLESS RAIN HAS ROTTED YOUR POPLAR TOMB. The cliff you were buried in erodes and is swallowed by the raging sea. Your fingers pierce the sodden earth and you pull yourself from its womb. Droplets vanish into your papyrus skin. Funeral rags hang loose upon your withered frame, drooping as they wet. You stare into the puddle that forms in your muddy afterbirth. You do not recognize what you see, nor what used to fill the husk that stares back. These things will come.

IN TIME, YOU WILL BE WHOLE AGAIN. As a husk, your DM will roll on the PIECES OF THE WHOLE table d3 times. Each time you complete a goal, or are broken, ask your GM to reveal to you a piece as a part of your past self returns. 

| d6  | PIECES OF THE WHOLE                                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You were buried with an heirloom. You left it behind in your grave. |
| 2   | Two scars run long your shoulder blades. You remember wings.        |
| 3   | This is not how it was supposed to go. You were an heir.            |
| 4   | Your hands are not your own. You remember who you took them from.   |
| 5-6 | You remember who did this to you. (Multiple people if rolled twice) |

# 10-5, STAIN
*Trap*
### **MIRICENT'S STAINED GLASS**

### AN INTRICATE PANE of stained glass impends upon the pews below. Rays of light of every color emanate from its surface, painting the church in hues not seen for generations; although, no sunlight passes through the window. The congregation kneels before the pane, their hands stretching towards the portal as if they were trying to grasp the light itself. The pastor, a withered man engulfed in the backlight leads the knelt in prayer:

*PRAISE MIRICENT for his gentling! PRAISE!*

*PRAISE MIRICENT for his warmth! PRAISE!*

*PRASE MIRICENT for his cure! PRAISE!*

*FOR IT IS BY HIS GRACE that I can see the light! BY HIS GRACE!*

*AND BY HIS HAND that I can feel the sun! BY HIS HAND!*

*AND BY HIS WILL that my blood flows! BY HIS WILL!*

### You can't help but to gaze upon it, maybe there's something you're not seeing...

For each round spent gazing upon the glass, gain HP then make a Presence test or fall to your knees and join the congregation, embracing MIRICENT's warmth. Each round spent staring grants you more HP and increases the Presence test DR. Repeat Presence test each dawn to awake to dark reality.

# 10-4, HOWL
*Mystery*

A PROPHESYING WIND HOWLS along the Whispering Coast down to the Dahlmore Mountains. 

# " 
## THE SHADOW PRINCE takes his watch atop a lonely tower 
## HIS FATHER ROTS upon his throne, nigh his final hour
## HE HOWLS TO the sea, his fingers rake the sky
## MY BOY SHALL never rule, for I shall never die!
# "

# 10-3, DAGGERS
*Power*

PALE ONES' DAGGERS

THE PALE ELVES, HAIRLESS CREATURES OF MOONLIT FLESH, forged three terrible daggers each with their own voracious inscription. Driven mad by the moon, the Pale Elves devoured each other and the daggers were lost. The Blood Countess covets them for she knows that the daggers' inscriptions will be revealed when wet with blood. Read them to channel their powers.

| **d3** | **PALE DAGGER INSCRIPTIONS**                                                                                                                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1      | GAZE UPON THE BLEEDING MOON: A great orb of moonlight appears above a creature's head for d6 rounds, all bathed in the light are compelled to attack the creature. |
| 2      | SEEK LUNAR COUNSEL: You are teleported to the moon for d4 rounds. Presence test each round to seek wisdom from the lunar presence.                                 |
| 3      | WITH MOONLIT EYES: Your eyes flash with blinding moonlight. 2 creatures take d6 damage and you are blinded for d2 rounds.                                          |

# 10-2, MAW
*Location*

**THE LIPS THAT SPEAK OF A NEW WORLD**

THERE'S A MOUTH BENEATH THE GOBLIN HILLS. Follow the steps beneath the crumbling basilisk church and you'll find it. The stone walls of the lowest chamber bead with condensation from its breath. Its maw is large enough to down an ox in a single bite. It senses fresh corpses and smiles as they approach; crimson gums betray perfectly white teeth sharpened on the bones of its last meal. 

AS LONG AS IT LIVES, IT HUNGERS. As long as flesh walks the earth, it will be satiated. The Cult of Open Lips--forever smiling madmen from across the lands--don their cloaks of crimson and harvest the Goblin Hills. A corpse wagon follows them, piled high with goblin spawn, their master's acquired taste.

A PEARL GROWS BENEATH ITS TONGUE. It is said that the pearl will become a new world once it is fully formed, once the lips' hunger is satiated...

| d4  | Adventure Hooks                                                                                       |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | The cult and their cart creep closer to civilized lands. This must not be. AMBUSH.                    |
| 2   | The Kind King's suicide march looms near. You must show him the pearl, show him hope.                 |
| 3   | You seek family in the cult. Ride on their corpse cart. There's a body in the pile that shouldn't be. |
| 4   | You awaken beneath a mound of goblins. You fell in battle. Must escape the lips.                      |

# 10-1, FROG
*Monster*

I am not fond of frogs or toads. Videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ctqr0RSoQY0) always freaked me out growing up. Here is a terrible creature of slimy skin and tacky tongue.

**Grelb, Scum Frog**

**HP** 32 | **Morale** 6 | **Thick Hide** d2 | **Strike** 2d4 or **Tongue** d6 + special
**Special:** Either pull target to self or disarm target.

BENEATH THE UNDEAD VALLEY'S SHIMMERING SCUM a creature with a tongue the length of two men marinates in the cursed muck, waiting for its next meal. The frog attacks with surprise and tries to drag its victim beneath the scum. If drawn out of the muck, the frog expels a stinking bubble of swamp curse from its maw each round. The target tests Agility DR14 or is covered in swamp curse for 1 day. Swamp creatures are attracted to the smell like a hound is attracted to a limp ewe.
