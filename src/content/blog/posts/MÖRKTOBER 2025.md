# 10/1: FROG
*Monster statblock*

I am not fond of frogs or toads. Videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ctqr0RSoQY0) always freaked me out growing up. Here is a terrible creature of slimy skin and tacky tongue.

## Grelb, Scum Frog

**HP** 32 | **Morale** 6 | **Thick Hide** d2 | **Strike** 2d4 or **Tongue** d6 + **special**

**Special:** Either pull target to self or disarm target.

BENEATH THE SHIMMERING SCUM a creature with a tongue the length of two men marinates in the cursed muck, waiting for its next meal. The frog attacks with surprise and tries to drag its victim beneath the scum. If drawn out of the muck, the frog expels a stinking bubble of swamp curse from its maw each round. The target tests Agility DR14 or is covered in swamp curse for 1 day. Swamp creatures are attracted to the smell like a hound is attracted to a limp ewe.

*Captured 50s ... Eyes 75s ... Tongue 200 s*
