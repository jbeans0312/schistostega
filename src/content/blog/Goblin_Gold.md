Schistostega is a luminous green moss that grows in caves. The moss is also known as goblin's gold or dragon's gold since it can easily be mistaken for loose emeralds when discovered. I like the idea of goblins having green gold almost as much as I like the idea of glowing moss found in caves--so let's play with that idea! From now on, my goblins have green gold.

Goblins are the quintessential fantasy miscreants, surely they would source their riches from other sapient creatures with decidedly non-green currency, so there must be something that transforms it. What if the gold slowly turned green merely from being around enough goblins, like fruit on an wicked vine? It follows that goblins wouldn't just be ripening the gold to sit in their coffers. Once the gold is sufficiently green, they "feed" it to their deities, who could never be satiated with unripe gold! 

As far as ripening mechanics go, I don't think a transmutation ritual is necessary. Goblins are inherently magical creatures, so in my setting they'll simply exude magic that turns their riches green. The more goblins, the quicker the process. Again, while there isn't a ritual, I think the process would be expedited if the goblins were focusing on transmutation.

| Goblins Focusing on Transmutation | Transmutation Rate (gp/day) |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Solo (1)                          | 2                           |
| Scouting party (~2-3)             | 10                          |
| Patrol (~4-10)                    | 50                          |
| Raiding Party (~11-25)            | 250                         |
| Small Horde (~26-50)              | 1250                        |
| Horde (~51-100)                   | 6250                        |

Per the above table, the rate of transformation is exponential: a sole goblin would need to covet and massage a necklace for days for it to *gobbify*, whereas a horde of dozens of goblins could ripen a monarch's purse in an evening if they were intent on it. Additionally, the transformation is permanent, once it's green, **it's green**. Although in your setting you might include an adventure-worthy location that could cleanse the gold.

Now all that's left is to mechanically devalue goblin gold, thereby encouraging decisive action to recover the gold before it's green. This is easy enough, goblins imbibe their green gold with their wyrd magic, putting those who covet it at risk for a painful and socially outcasting mutation. In short, cursed green gold is extremely illiquid and more trouble than its worth.

| 1   | Plague of Gnats. Your skin turns a sickly green and a swarm of gnats materializes  whenever you eat, mingle, and sleep. They can be trained.                  |
| 2   | Your fingers on your left hand meld together and calcify, transforming your hand into a flat scooped hook.                                                    |
| 3   | You have an urge to steal from strangers, it causes your skin to itch and crawl. The longer you subdue the urge, the greater the theft must be to satisfy it. |
| 4   | Cave Creature. You are only able to sleep when underground. 1 in 4 chance to wake somewhere nearby with no memory of how you got there.                       |
With this kind of goblin magic at play, recovering stolen gold becomes a race against time; regents and nobles are willing to spend a good portion of their gold to avoid losing it all, which is where our first adventure begins.
### Depreciating Assets

 **Inciting incident:** A tax collector's caravan was ambushed by goblins en route to the regent's keep from a nearby village. A handful of the guard outfit survived, but the strongbox was stolen in all the confusion.
 **Reward:** The crown will pay a tenth of the remaining "clean" gold for the strongbox's return.  
 **Secrets & Clues**
 - Trappers spotted shamanic markings near the ruined church in the woods to the east.
 - The church was devoted to an old god of trickery.
 - A surviving guardsmen claims he saw a horned human fighting alongside the goblins
 - Unknown to the adventurers and the crown, there is an unopened letter in the strongbox addressed to the regent. It contains incriminating information.

The other adventure idea I had focuses on the If not for the telltale color, I imagine goblin gold being indistinguishable from unripe gold, which opens the door for some *accursed* counterfeit.
